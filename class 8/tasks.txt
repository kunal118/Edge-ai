Feature detection
Camera->Preprocessing->feature detection

Feature detection
->Key point based(Select few points in the image and select features from around them)
->Local features(dividing grid)
->Global features .. Mean(dark images) Std deviation(constrast) skewness Kurtosis edge*(pixel based global feature)

High pass filters for image sharpness
Sharpened Image  = Image  + Edge detected image

Transform based Feature
DCT
FFT(Fast fourier Transform)
Gabor

e^-(2*pi*t**2) class

FFT(Fast fourier Transform)

Frequency here is dif in pixel values
Gabor (bakchod cheez)

Local features
LBP(texture information)
Local Binary pattern(exam)


22 33 100
40 55 72
11 03 07

check what values are less than 55

0 0 1
0   1
0 0 0
calculate middle value by moving anticli=ockwise from middle right ele

2**0 * 1 + 2**1 * 1 + 2**2 *0 ......2**7*0

create a histogram of number of 0,1,2,3 ...255


benefit of FFT
take FFT
